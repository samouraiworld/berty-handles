                            emergence of new technologies like Web 3 tools unlocks a ton of opportunities. Today, thanks
                            to these amazing technologies, anyone can create a sustainable business without making any
                            compromises. Let’s write it down: The era of concessions is now over. Let’s do the right
                            thing, for the right purposes. Let's redefine together what is achievable and what we really
                            hope for in the future. Everyone has the individual power to decide - and it starts with a
                            simple yet fundamental thing such as choosing a communication solution.

                        <p>Over the past decade, instant messaging applications have become increasingly popular.
                            WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Telegram and WeChat are certainly among the best-known. Have
                            you ever wondered, will these applications still exist in 10, 20 or even 30 years? Do you
                            foresee these applications still existing in 2050? <br>
                            To us, none of today’s messenger solutions are able to bring certain degree of confidence to
                            use it, without fearing censorship or surveillance and were able to ensure that our own data
                            would not be used against us, we decided to build our own. Berty is a new kind of messenger.
                            It is decentralized, unstoppable,<br>un-censurable, secure, made for the future, and in a
                            pure

                        <p>Centralization has allowed billions of people to access the World Wide Web and create the
                            stable and robust infrastructure on which it is based. At the same time, a handful of
                            centralized entities have taken control of large parts of the World Wide Web, unilaterally
                            deciding what is and is not allowed.Web3 is the answer to this dilemma. Unlike a Web
                            dominated by large technology companies, Web3 is decentralized and is built, operated and
                            owned by its users. Web3 gives power to individuals rather than corporations.<br><br>Web3 is
                            about digital sovereignty for individuals, businesses and governments. It means no
                            longer letting anyone decide for everyone what the Internet should look like.

                            Berty is designed to be privacy responsible and why even as a founding team we have no

                            entity. Privacy is not a business model.

                            the obstacles that may come our way. They can be natural, like an earthquake, a tornado
                            (think Haiti) or man-made: the madness of censorship and surveillance of certain individuals
                            out of the sheer urge to control populations (think China). Or maybe even tomorrow we will
                            be in areas never explored before (think of Mars). We don't know what the future is. We just
                            want to be prepared and make Berty the communication tool that can withstand whatever
                            obstacles may come our way. In short, Berty, your next unstoppable messenger, no matter
